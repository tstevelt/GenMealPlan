This report uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find a good solution from the trillions of possible combinations of foods which closely match your macro targets.  If you are selecting commonly used foods, then the report runs quickly.  If you select from all foods, then it will take about 30 seconds to find a good solution.  There are many possible good solutions to this problem, so every time you run the report, it will give you a different list of foods.

A Genetic Algorithm find daily food plan which satisfies 6 parameters.

Parameters to be met:
	* Calorie
	* Carbohydrates
	* Protein
	* Fat
	* Sodium
	* Fiber

Methodology
	* Variable length chromosomes. 10 to 30 foods per day.
	* Polyamorous crossover.  Some parents will be left behind, possibly even the best one(s).
	* Mutation accomplished by replacing a food in the individual chromosome with another from this food list; after checking that the new food is not already in the chromosome.  Replacement site is randomly selected.

Random function
	* Random function is seeded with current microsecond at program startup.  This limits the number of possible solutions to one-million.  Adding or removing even one food to the initial database, should result in addition one-million possible solutions.
